Using the following summaries of different parts of a lecture that together comprise the entire lecture, make a summary that lists the 3-5 main topics along with short key takeaways from those topics. Add subtopics with their own short key takeaways when reasonable.  For each topic: mention from which summary number the information was sourced.
Finish your response with another section with in-depth summaries of 100-300 words for each of the main topics. Format your response in markdown following the convention:
{
# Summary

## <Topic 1>
### Sourced from Summary <x>
- **<Sub-topic>**:
   - ...

- **...**:
   -...

# In-Depth Summaries

## <Topic 1>
...
}

Remember to replace anything between and including "<" and ">" with the actual topics and sub-topics.
