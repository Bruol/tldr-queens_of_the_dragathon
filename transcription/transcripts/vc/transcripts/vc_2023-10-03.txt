 (audience murmuring)
 Excuse me.
 Let's start the class.
 Okay, well I'm covering from Professor Mark Poliface
 because he is on a conference.
 And well, we are going to do today convolutions
 and filtering.
 So basically a small recap of what you did last week
 as far as he told me.
 You did segmentation, so you basically learned
 to do foreground and background segmentation
 and based to evaluate it with Rock Curve.
 Basically if you don't remember something of this,
 please look it up since you will have the practice classes.
 So I would recommend to look that
 because it's really important.
 Okay, so let's start.
 What is image filtering?
 So basically the definition of image filtering
 could be the modification of pixels in an image
 based on some functions of a local neighborhood of the pixels.
 So basically as you can see here,
 this is a local image data.
 So basically this is a random image.
 We are applying something on it
 which basically gives us a modified output with a seven.
 What is this something?
 So basically those are image filters.
 Okay, so basically one of the simplest types
 of image filters are line shift invariant filtering.
 What is line shift invariant filtering?
 Basically they are modified pixels
 based on the neighborhood.
 So if you have worked before with pixels,
 they are the ones that you have probably seen.
 They are as said the simplest ones.
 They are linear means, linear combination of neighbors,
 linear methods.
 Again, it's the simplest ones and how to apply.
 And basically, yeah, so they are shift invariant.
 Sorry, I had to run to get the adapter.
 So I'm kind of out of breath,
 but yeah, we'll get better.
 Okay, so basically they are shift invariant
 means doing the same for each pixel
 and basically for what they are used for.
 Basically you have applied them on images,
 so low level image processing,
 smoothing and noise reduction,
 sharpening and detecting or enhancing features.
 Okay, so basically how do we know it's a linear filter?
 Basically this equation has to be every time true.
 So basically a linear filter is every time
 for a constant alpha and beta for each of them,
 we need to basically be able to prove this equation.
 So if we separate them, this needs to be true.
 Okay, so basically you can see here,
 basically as an example of a linear operation
 is a weighted summation.
 So basically the output is the image filter
 on a linear image operation is the weighted sum
 of a constant alpha multiplied by the image
 on coordinates i and g.
 Okay, so basically you have here the equation,
 so basically k is the kernel,
 which is what we're going to multiply.
 It has normally a size on coordinate x and y
 and then we have the image on the coordinates i and j.
 Okay, so basically what's the important part out of this,
 it's basically they are shift invariant.
 So this basically means k does not depend on x and y,
 so it's always the same on the entire image.
 This is kind of the most important part,
 you need to kind of keep in mind for this.
 So let's start with basically image filters.
 We have first of all correlations.
 So an example template matching.
 So what is the correlation?
 Basically you can see here, we have our image
 with our coordinates j minus y, j and j plus one,
 which is the section we have decided to apply the filter.
 And then we have the coordinates on the horizontal,
 which is i minus one, i and i plus one.
 And this basically our correlation mask,
 which we are going to apply on that image.
 Does anyone know what, how this is going to look like,
 the correlation equation?
 Anyone?
 Nobody has any idea?
 Okay, that's great.
 So basically the first coordinate is going to be
 the correlation in position one one.
 And we're basically having the image in the position
 one minus one, j minus one.
 Does anyone can tell me what's the next term?
 Anyone?
 It's going to be a long class if you don't participate.
 I'm just letting you know.
 Well, so as it is obvious, the coordinate one two
 and the correlation, we have the image
 and basically the coordinate is j and i minus one.
 Next one.
 Exactly.
 Okay, so you got the gist out of it.
 So basically it's the summation of each of the positions
 here as you can see.
 So basically this is how we move over the image.
 There.
 So this is how basically the correlation on an applied
 three by three filter on an image is going to look.
 Okay, so this is kind of like logic until here.
 Everyone, everything's clear, right?
 Okay.
 Let's move to the next part.
 Basically, how do we say that in a mathematical formula?
 So basically the mathematical formula of a correlation is
 the linear operation is equal to a kernel,
 which is always the same on the entire image,
 correlation of an image.
 So basically what is the correlation?
 It's a summation of k and coordinates a and g
 and multiplied by the image in the coordinate x plus one,
 i plus j.
 And yeah, basically k is the weight
 and it's always constant.
 So okay, let's move to one of the examples.
 So basically, not the examples,
 we are doing now the opposite.
 So this is a convolution.
 Has anyone of you maybe worked with deep learning?
 Yes?
 You know convolutions?
 You have noticed that it is the correlations in this case.
 So do you know how a convolution works?
 The classic standard convolution?
 Okay, it's an explanation.
 But it's good that you know the difference.
 So okay, basically what your colleague said,
 but in a bit more detail is basically,
 we're having here the kernel with the coordinates,
 which is basically what you had beforehand.
 And we're having our image,
 but in this case we're not having a size of three by three.
 We just want to basically do what we can see here.
 We're having that point and we are actually spreading it.
 So basically you can see what's going to happen.
 In this case we start from the other end.
 So basically the first term is our kernel position one by one
 on the image x minus y i minus one.
 So basically who knows the next one?
 Anyone?
 Wow, okay.
 So basically that will be the first one,
 which brings us to the next one.
 So as basically you correctly said,
 in this case the filter is actually not static
 on the position, it's pivoting over it.
 So we're actually moving over the image.
 As you can see in the next,
 we're literally every time the kernel is moving
 and basically aiming for that one pixel.
 And basically this is how it's going to look.
 As you can see, okay.
 So basically this is the main difference
 between a correlation and a convolution.
 Okay, so basically this is the mathematical function
 of a convolution, which is basically a convolution
 is a kernel convoluted on an image,
 which is basically the outcome of the summation
 of a basically constant kernel on coordinates ij
 on an image x minus one i minus one minus j.
 Here you can see actually showcased
 basically the difference on the math,
 like what is the difference between one and another.
 You can see it's a change of symbols.
 Okay.
 So basically these are the two things
 you need to keep in mind because basically
 for image filters, we are going to use this.
 So yes, basically these are the two most important ones.
 So now I need you to participate
 because literally this is not going to work if you don't.
 We're having this image.
 Some of you maybe have seen it.
 This is the image of Albert Einstein.
 We're having that filter.
 What happens?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 Exactly.
 Just remains the same.
 Can you tell us why?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 Exactly.
 Okay, so have the next one for you.
 Original image.
 This is the convolution.
 What will happen?
 There are a lot of these.
 So the earlier you start participating,
 the funnier it gets.
 Yes?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 Are you sure it's to the right?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 No, so basically it's, you were sure close,
 but yeah, it's literally in the other way,
 in the other direction.
 It's just a one pixel shift.
 What happens here?
 Yes?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 What?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 The opposite.
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 This is like, okay, this is really a mean one.
 So it's basically, we are assuming each three by three
 neighborhood which ends up saturating the image.
 So that's why a wide image is coming out of here.
 Okay, next one.
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 Exactly, really good.
 Okay, now we have different convolutions
 that we're applying all on the same.
 Any guesses?
 Yes?
 (audience member speaking off mic)
 Nope, we are sharpening actually.
 So basically with this filter,
 what we're doing is basically,
 as you already said before,
 we have the averaging but basically we're giving
 actually more importance to the filters,
 which is this one.
 So that's why you're literally,
 it looks sharpener but just because you're enhancing
 the pixels that have actually a variation,
 like a higher number.
 Okay, so this is how a sharpened image looks.
 As you can see, so it's kind of relative
 what sharpening means.
 It's basically you're having the before image,
 you're having the after image.
 You can see we have of course sharpened details
 on the scene but we're also having more noise
 because we are enhancing also smaller details
 that we maybe don't want.
 Okay, so now that you're experts on convolutions
 and correlations, we basically have here
 just a quick reminder what we had basically.
 Yes?
 I'm sorry, these are not my slides.
 Okay, so basically as you just remind this
 because now we're going to see some outputs of MATLAB
 actually applying this kind of correlations
 and convolutions to images.
 Yes.
 So basically you can see here,
 this is how you would do this in MATLAB.
 So you're having a kernel of nine by nine
 and you're basically applying convolution
 on the image and on the kernel.
 And as you can see, we're having this image of the fishes
 and basically by applying that kernel,
 we're seeing that we are blurring it
 and basically you can also see this kind of
 interesting phenomenon which is basically
 because of the application of the kernel,
 we're getting this black border around the image
 which you will see in a bit.
 We will talk about that there's,
 this can't really get to extreme results basically.
 Okay, so here's another filter
 which is basically as you can see,
 we're having basically a vertical filter.
 So it's basically going to enhance actually
 vertical information in the image.
 So as you can see, it's quite hard to see sadly
 with the projector.
 But so we are having of course some horizontal lines,
 but they are less sharpener than actually here,
 the lines of the fishes which are basically the details.
 So basically what this filter is literally doing
 is enhancing actually the vertical information in the image.
 And basically also since it is this type of filter,
 what we're doing is we are changing,
 that's why the image is actually black.
 So basically it's actually like saturating the part
 that is stark in the other part, not.
 Okay, so basically this brings us to this kind of details,
 what happens with the edges?
 Of course we have been already having always
 this kind of nice kernel which we were applying
 in the middle of the image,
 but what do we do with the borders?
 So basically here we have different options
 to what to do.
 So basically we can do a clip filter
 which is basically this.
 We can add a black filter,
 but so basically if we apply convolution,
 we're having this which is a blurred image.
 And as you can see,
 like literally if we're cutting this out,
 we're having this black border
 which we literally don't want
 if we're applying this on images, right?
 I mean, we're basically putting artifacts
 in the image that we don't want.
 So we have a second option
 which is basically rub the image around.
 So basically as you can see,
 this is just copies of the same image,
 but does anyone can guess what the issue with this is?
 Okay, so basically as you can see in the upper part,
 so probably in an image
 that does not have that much changes,
 kind of like this would work,
 but in the upper part you can actually see
 that basically the red part
 which is the copy of this.
 If we apply convolution or a filter on it,
 we have the blur of the red.
 So you can see actually the red pixels
 are really present up there.
 So if we basically cut it out,
 we're having red artifacts in the upper part.
 So that's again, not interesting for us.
 So other options we have,
 we can copy the edges
 which basically gives you this kind of fun looking image
 which basically has,
 this is all kind of extended.
 So basically this one is actually one of the best ones
 because literally we're convoluting
 and you can already see
 that the borders are staying in the same kind
 of color patterns.
 So basically if we cut this out,
 we're actually having a blurred image.
 We don't have any random artifacts in the scene
 and it's all kind of like looking good.
 Okay, which moves us to the next one.
 We are having the reflect across,
 basically as you can see here.
 So what we're doing is we're reflecting a part of the image.
 We're actually reflecting it.
 Any guesses what will happen here?
 Yes.
 (man speaking off mic)
 (man speaking off mic)
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Just in this case,
 it will be much smaller than in the other case
 where we literally were duplicating the image.
 So in this case,
 if we apply the convolution,
 we won't just not see what you were mentioning
 because basically we could see this here in this line,
 but basically since it is convoluted,
 we can't really see any difference.
 And then basically this is kind of what happens cut out.
 Or the other option we have is basically
 we can vary the filter in the borders.
 So basically on the borders,
 we just change the kernel size
 to basically do the kind of adaptations.
 Okay.
 Which brings us to the next thing.
 Since we were talking about the kernel,
 lastly, basically let's talk about separable kernels.
 So basically a separate kernel
 as a part of two dependent filters
 along rows and columns respectively.
 So basically you can see F is rows, G is columns.
 So as you can see,
 this is the output of a separable kernel.
 So that's kind of the function that you're going to have
 and this can be split in these two.
 So basically what we're doing first
 is we're doing a convolution on the columns or on the rows.
 And then we're doing the second one,
 basically on both of them.
 Which basically, okay.
 Question time, I know you don't like it, but yeah.
 Which basically are the computational advantages
 of doing this?
 Any guess?
 Yes.
 (man speaking off mic)
 Exactly, that's one of the reasons.
 From a mathematical point of view,
 we're also changing, basically you can see,
 we're having complexity two M plus one multiplied two N plus one
 which basically we can actually change
 from quadratic to linear because by doing it like this,
 we transform this in a summation actually.
 So it would be two M plus one plus two N plus one.
 So basically that's why we are really using separable kernels
 because they are really interesting for us.
 Mostly, okay.
 So now you basically have talked about like blurring kernels.
 We have talked about some sharpening kernels.
 Okay, let's move to smoothing kernels.
 We have basically the low pass filters,
 which basically you have the mean filter
 which you have seen before.
 So basically this is going to blur the image
 since it is basically the top filter gives the same way
 to all the pixels.
 Basically the bottom left filter, which is that one,
 is basically giving more importance to the central pixel
 while the bottom right one also gives more importance
 to the closer pixels to the center.
 So basically you can see the difference between them.
 Why to the pixels to the center basically
 because the distance between this one is actually considered one
 while between the other ones is literally considered
 basically distance of the square root.
 So it's over one.
 So basically that's why there's bigger distance
 in the diagonals than actually on the lines.
 Okay.
 So basically yes, these are the smoothing kernels.
 You have seen them before,
 which brings us to Gaussian kernels.
 Okay, I mean I assume you mostly have seen Gaussian kernels.
 I think you're third semester, right?
 So you have started to see already these things.
 So basically a Gaussian kernel is mostly known.
 It's actually used mostly for your scores.
 That's why maybe a lot of people know it.
 Basically a Gaussian kernel,
 this is a representation of a 2D Gaussian kernel in 3D.
 As you can see here,
 basically you're having the representation.
 So what does this mean?
 Basically this is the mathematical equation.
 So we're basically giving more importance
 to the center kernel and the neighborhood
 while we are not giving importance to the other ones.
 So basically one of the interesting things about this
 is that the constant factor at front
 makes volume summation of one.
 Okay.
 So basically this is how a Gaussian kernel
 actually looks like.
 So as you can see what we're doing literally smoothing.
 So we are having this original image,
 which is already quite blurry.
 Not sure if it is because of this resize of it
 or what it is exactly.
 But yeah, basically is the blurry outcome
 that you can see not a great outcome.
 Okay.
 And basically to kind of show you a difference
 because in this case like a Gaussian,
 it has the Gaussian form, so it's kind of circular.
 That's why you're having that image.
 We can also have box filters.
 So basically box filters,
 if some of you have worked with neural networks,
 you can actually often see in convolutions
 when you can sadly not see it.
 Technically you would be able to see in this image
 that there is actually like a grid appearing.
 And basically this grid is often happening
 from the convolutions that we're doing in deep learning.
 So it basically often means that the network is not trained
 but it's not related in this case.
 But basically you're doing box kernels
 which is kind of, it's giving a pattern on the image.
 So basically this is kind of that you know
 you have two different types.
 You have the gaussians and you have the box filters
 which are basically giving importance
 to the entire filter.
 Okay.
 So basically the Gaussian smoothing kernel,
 basically this is the mathematical equation.
 It's basically depending on the standard deviation.
 And as you can see again,
 maybe if you remember from some slides five minutes ago,
 this is actually separable.
 So that's why we like Gaussian kernels
 because basically we can work with them
 and we can do them quicker
 and basically they are much more cost efficient
 and memory efficient.
 Okay.
 So to show you basically because I'm showing you a lot of like
 how this is kind of applied on a mathematical term.
 But let's see.
 So basically here you can actually see the Gaussian smoothing kernel,
 how it looks when we apply this actually.
 So basically this depends on the standard deviation
 of the window size.
 So basically to keep in mind one of the,
 basically one of the conclusions you need to kind of keep out of this
 is basically that the result reminds roughly the same
 for filter sizes greater than three standard deviation.
 So basically that's kind of the important one.
 So basically this is the original image.
 We have a kernel seven by seven
 with a standard deviation of one.
 Applying this on a standard deviation of nine,
 you can already see we're blurring the image.
 And since in this one we were already having a black border,
 you can see, not great, but you can see
 the border is already getting thicker.
 This is basically depending on the application of the kernel.
 Doing the same thing with the kernel size of 19 by 19
 with a standard deviation,
 you can see that the border from here to actually here,
 duplicated already.
 While if we apply standard deviation of nine,
 you can see that actually,
 first of all the image is much blurrier
 than before with the bigger kernel size.
 And second, we're having a much thicker black border.
 Also keep in mind that here the images are cut out.
 So there's some part missing.
 So just keep that in mind.
 This is kind of to give you an idea
 of what basically you are looking into.
 I'm going quite quick.
 So basically, do you have any questions so far?
 Is there anything?
 Okay.
 Um, that's good.
 I mean, you will probably be able then to leave earlier.
 Okay.
 Or do you want to do the break now?
 Any comments?
 What, yeah?
 Okay, then go for the break.
 Okay.
 Some of you basically came to ask me some questions.
 Would I'm kind of assume that basically,
 if some of you asked,
 then basically all the others have no clue about it.
 Which is a strong assumption, I know.
 But it's just, I want to really clarify
 because in the end you are starting the semester right now
 and especially convolutions and correlations
 are actually really important.
 And they are really something that kind of like,
 you should have kind of clear and understood.
 So, I mean, I think correlations,
 you kind of all understood them correctly.
 There was, I think, no question in that.
 You basically understood that we're having
 a fixed correlation mass that is applied on the image.
 So basically it's moving,
 but basically it's always this three by three
 by three by three on an image.
 And we're basically doing the summation
 of all the operations.
 Is that clear?
 (student speaking faintly)
 Okay.
 Basically now comes the part where basically
 it's a bit more abstract to understand
 with the convolution.
 So in this case, I can just tell you
 how it was for me the easiest to understand this,
 but basically it's a bit of an abstract term to understand.
 So first of all, as you can see,
 it is already starting different.
 Why?
 Because basically what we're doing is we're having our point
 and what the kernel is doing,
 it's actually moving over the neighborhood of that point.
 So that's why the first kernel point is not the one
 as we had in the correlation, which was the upper one.
 It's the other diagonal.
 That's why K11 is the first one.
 And basically in the next image,
 you can see that the kernel, what it is doing,
 it's basically moving over the neighborhood of the blue pixel.
 In every of the operations,
 you can see that what we are doing is moving
 of the neighboring pixel.
 So we're basically pivoting over the neighborhood.
 And this is what comes out.
 That's also why basic, sorry, I was told
 I should not use basically.
 It's just a filling word.
 But what, the main difference is as you can see
 on a mathematical point of view is the difference of sign.
 Yes?
 - I have a question.
 In the image, it seems like every time you use K00
 for each neighboring pixel,
 that's your K because you have the center of the kernel
 and then you always took the center
 for each one of the neighboring.
 - Wait, what?
 - In the image control.
 - Yes.
 - It seems like you're always using the center
 of the kernel because you are currently in the kernel
 and always to take the center.
 So every time you take K00
 (audience member laughs)
 No, I'm not taking that.
 As you can see in the Mathematic Formula,
 it's a bit difficult to draw.
 It's the pixel of the kernel that is over that point.
 So the one that is in blue,
 but the center of the kernel is the one
 that is basically shown to you.
 So you're having the arrow that is pointing to it,
 but it's because the convolution is
 the entire kernel position one, one
 on the image in position X minus one,
 I minus Y minus one.
 So even if the image is made confusing
 you see that we're actually not using
 always kernel size in the center.
 We are not using kernel 00.
 We're actually moving.
 The image is, I apologize for the image
 but I didn't make the slides.
 I also don't know how to better draw it
 because if I put you just a point
 and I make it move over them
 you then would be probably more confused.
 But is the difference like on a mathematical point of view,
 you have the two compared?
 Like is that clear now?
 Yes.
 - [Man] Notice the bottom,
 do you always represent a correlation
 whatever that effect on the image
 could you achieve the same effect with the convolution
 because there always a corresponding correlation
 for every convolution?
 - Yeah.
 - [Man] It's just a different way of achieving the same.
 I guess why would you use one or the other?
 - Because one is the opposite of the other.
 It's basically, you have the kernel of ij
 which is the correlation and the convolution is the opposite
 which brings me to the next point
 which there were some questioning
 which was with this image.
 It says use convolution
 but if you actually use the correlation it's the inverse
 and when you're using a correlation
 basically what you're doing is on the right side
 you're taking the white pixels
 so you're shifting everything
 that's why it shifted to the left.
 So this convolution turned is a correlation
 with the one on the other side.
 I'm trying to just come up with other ways
 of explaining you things
 and basically you can then make your own mental path
 on how this makes sense or not
 and now is your chance to ask
 if you have some questions.
 - Yes.
 - Before going over this again,
 I expected the shift to be in the other direction.
 Would it be possible to explain it yet again
 maybe as an equation?
 - As an equation, not really.
 I can't really like help you on that.
 I just really like can explain to you on a theoretical level
 but yet.
 - Maybe am I allowed to ask
 if someone understands why the direction is to the left?
 Why is it the left?
 - So I had the exact same confusion.
 I think your current thing is that we apply the one
 to the pixels to the left of the center, right?
 So the new pixel is just a pixel
 that is originally to the left.
 Is that what you're currently thinking?
 That's why it shifts to the right.
 If you look at the convolution,
 you see that you actually apply the left factor
 of the filter to the pixel
 that is to the right of the center.
 It's kind of reflected along the middle point
 along the center.
 We look at the slides afterwards
 with the equation of the convolution.
 So if this was a kind of a mask for a correlation,
 you would have exactly what you think.
 So it would shift to the right.
 - But if I take the right pixel,
 the original image,
 then I get the shift to the right.
 - You know, so you have this pixel
 and then you pixel in this position
 is just the position to the pixel to the right.
 So you just kind of do everything to the left.
 - I don't know.
 Can I have any order of word here, explain it?
 - Yes.
 - I stated it before,
 also that you shift it to the right,
 but the convolution, I think this filter,
 I misunderstood in the way that I thought
 for each pixel we would take the left,
 the one to its left,
 because the left, the center left cell in the filter is one,
 but it's actually the other pixel
 but it's actually the other way around for each pixel.
 We apply the filter and spread its value according to this.
 So for each, in this case for each pixel,
 the thing in this position is shifted one to the left
 because that's the only cell in the filter that's the one.
 If I understood this correctly.
 - Does that make sense? - Thank you.
 - Yes.
 - Does correlation and convolution the same
 just mirror across the diagonal?
 - I mean, you can.
 - Not across the diagonal, not across the center.
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Just to see if I have it right,
 if the pixel, like the only entry in the filter
 that was one with the top left corner,
 would every pixel be shifted off into the left?
 - Yeah.
 - Yes.
 I think so.
 Yeah?
 - I think what it does is it tells you
 when you have to filter on a pixel,
 and the pixel is what is in the middle of the filter,
 it tells you how much it goes to the left.
 So the one on the left side, the middle pixel,
 will get once the middle pixel,
 and all the other ones will get zero from this middle pixel.
 And then you move to filter.
 So every pixel will get some add-on from different pixels.
 But the best is to see the picture where you see the splinter,
 then it spreads it out.
 - The point where it spreads it out?
 - Yes. - Yeah.
 Imagine the pixel on the edge of the black point,
 and now you put the filter on it.
 That means part of the filter is on the point,
 and part of the filter is out of the point.
 And now the center pixel of your filter
 will be spread out around with the numbers in this integrated.
 And then you move to filter.
 So every pixel also gets added up from different central pixels.
 - More comments?
 Yeah.
 - I'm not confused why you would use the convolution over a correlation.
 It feels like a more convoluted representation.
 So I can tell you what you will use mostly if you decide,
 as an example, to move into research where we're using deep learning,
 which is the confusing part often when you have not teach,
 which is in my case.
 So basically a correlation is in deep learning actually convolution.
 Yes, it is totally contradictory.
 But literally what we are using in a convolution with pie torch,
 and the flow and everything is literally this.
 So the other thing, nobody is really using it of us.
 But you need to learn the basic knowledge of these things
 because right now you're really focusing on image filters,
 so you're really focusing on blurring,
 you're really focusing on sharpening,
 or all these things because you're third semester.
 But you need to learn the basics
 and then move to the more fun stuff.
 Yes.
 - I'm still a bit confused about the sequence of the...
 - Yeah?
 - ...if we go back to the...
 - Which slide?
 - The slide where the kernel is moving.
 - But isn't it this one?
 Or do you want another one?
 - I think it's the other one where you have to...
 - But wait, I think it's the same image,
 but just with the correlation next to it.
 - Okay, yeah.
 - So, like, if you go on...
 ...through each step, what is the x, y,
 and like in this image,
 each step, if you go to one step where there is a kernel,
 in display?
 - Wait, I'm...
 - Yeah, yeah.
 - Okay.
 - So, in this image, where is our x, y?
 That's the blue square, right?
 - Yeah.
 - And which...
 Where is the...
 ...the position of the kernel
 with that key multiplied?
 I mean...
 ...basically, I'm just trying to figure out where k0 -1 times ix, y + 1 is.
 But, okay.
 Let's start from the beginning,
 just because that's easier.
 So, you're having kernel 1, 1.
 Why is it that one?
 That, yes, right?
 - So, that is...
 - That one, yes.
 You understood that one.
 - Yeah.
 - Okay.
 K1, 1, you can see in the red, it's the lower pixel.
 And then, x - 1, i - 1,
 is because the center, so,
 x, y would be 0, and x - 1, i - 1.
 And then you're moving over it.
 So, the red square is giving you x, i - 1.
 [pause]
 You can see in k0 - 0, which is the blue is on top of the red, it's i, x, y.
 Now?
 - Yeah.
 - Okay.
 Makes sense?
 Okay.
 Is there anything more that you want to kind of go over that something is unclear
 that I went too fast?
 I know I went too fast.
 Yes?
 - How do you get to the computation of the rampage when you separate?
 - I had that question as well.
 Okay.
 Give me a second.
 I can show you the slide.
 [pause]
 Okay.
 You - I have heard from your colleagues that you already had, like, complexities and, like,
 basically, that you kind of know when a operation is linear or quadratic, so you have learned that before.
 You have seen that.
 So, basically, what you're having here, so, normally, a kernel, you can do two things.
 You would have this function, which is basically, you're having the columns and you're applying
 the - basically, the convolution on it, on the columns, and then you do the horizontals.
 Okay?
 So, basically, that's how it would work.
 You would do first diagonal, second horizontal, and that would be your operation.
 This, you can, of course, separate in two operations, two separate ones.
 One is just a convolution over the vertical, and the other one is a convolution of this.
 So, we are convoluting this, but over the horizontal.
 Okay.
 So, this is the mathematical equation.
 Why is it computational advantage?
 Of course, it's quicker, but why?
 And speaking in complexity, if we are doing all this in one step, we are having that complexity.
 So, it's actually a quadratic, which is basically two m, two columns plus one, multiplied by
 two horizontals plus one.
 While if we are basically separating this, we are having just the summation of two operations.
 So, it's linear.
 So, it's quicker.
 Doesn't make sense.
 It's not one inside of the other.
 It's one summed with the other.
 Does that...
 So, that's the filter size.
 Yeah.
 So, it's the filter size.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 You've clarified some of the speed m and n terms.
 Is that the filter?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 If there...
 Until here, it's everything clear.
 Then I will continue with the normal slides.
 I think we came until here, right?
 Yes.
 Does anyone remember?
 Okay.
 So, yeah.
 Basically, the scale space, which is basically what you have seen after seeing the Gaussian
 smoothing kernel, this brings us to the scale space.
 So, basically, a convolution of a Gaussian with standard deviation, which is going to
 be represented.
 Sigma with itself is a Gaussian standard deviation, which is the deviation of the square of two.
 So, basically, this sentence, which is repeated convolutions by a Gaussian filter, produces
 the scale space of an image.
 So, you're going to see this here.
 We're having the first image, which is the fishes you have seen before.
 Probably when Philip, who is the head TA of this, is going to upload the slides to you,
 you will have much sharper image.
 It technically should look quite good.
 But, basically, we're applying a convolution size 11 by 11 with the standard deviation of
 three.
 So, as you can see, every time I apply the convolution over the image, first, as you can see, this
 one is cut out, but the border should be actually much thicker.
 It was just cut out.
 But you can see that the image is getting blurr and blurr.
 Here, still, we are having some small details like on the fishes.
 We're having kind of like, we're still seeing some, like, also lighter details.
 There, already, most of the fish patterns are gone.
 Here, nothing's left besides the fishes.
 And the light fishes are also, like, gone already.
 So, this is kind of how, basically, the scale space.
 Yeah.
 [ Inaudible ]
 Wait, what are you pointing?
 [ Inaudible ]
 So, it is a bit tricky to say in this kind of case, because at this point, this is just
 the blurr.
 So, if you had this in MATLAB, you would be able to actually see the pixel, like, what
 is basically happening on the image.
 You could kind of check the coordinate.
 And, yeah, it's not growing inward.
 You're right on that.
 Is that what you said?
 [ Inaudible ]
 It's actually, sorry, it's growing inward.
 Yes.
 It is growing inward.
 But the problem is at this point, I can't even tell you on my high quality slide.
 If --
 [ Inaudible ]
 Yeah.
 The pictures are actually -- maybe I can show you, but, yeah, there is -- these pictures
 are from someone, from a photographer.
 So, they are just taken for the slideshow.
 It's not really that Mark made this.
 Yeah.
 Not only that.
 I mean, you can see in this image that just already the image size is different.
 And it's just because he cropped it.
 Okay.
 So, which basically brings up to the top five reasons to choose the Gaussian kernel, which
 is first, they are rotationally symmetric.
 Second, they have a single lobe.
 So, neighbors influence decreases monotonically.
 Still, one open frequency domain.
 Simple relationship between the standard deviation and easy to implement efficiently.
 Those are kind of the top reasons if you want to choose a Gaussian filter for your images
 from now on.
 So, now you have seen Gaussian filters.
 You have seen basically the ones that we are using for blurring and the one that we are
 using for sharpening.
 This brings us to differential filters.
 So, we are having proits and several operators.
 They look like this.
 So, you can see that they are mostly focusing on the vertical information on how the filters
 are made.
 These are the standard filters that you normally find when you Google image filters.
 Like, they are the general ones that you will find information about.
 Has anyone used them before or heard of them before?
 One person?
 Okay.
 You are not -- as far as I know, you are actually going to see these ones in more detail in
 the practical part.
 So, you are actually going to work with these.
 So, you are going to get more information about these.
 That is why we are currently moving to the high pass filters.
 Which maybe if they remind you a bit, at least to me, they remind me of a Gaussian filter.
 So, we are having the importance on the center pixel and we are having the surroundings.
 That one is basically enhancing the neighbors of the center.
 And this one is the high pass filter.
 Which in this case is of course not like Gaussian.
 But, yeah, basically we are putting the strength on the center pixel and, yeah, moving over
 the neighborhood.
 This is how this looks.
 So, in both cases, they are really similar.

 [ Inaudible ]
 Yes, it is minus.
 No, it is not. Sorry.
 [ Inaudible ]
 Okay.
 Any questions?
 No. Okay.
 So, we have seen now blurring filters.
 We have seen sharpening filters.
 These are face detection filters.
 So, does anyone notice something on these filters?
 What could those filters be showing?
 Maybe.
 Yeah.
 One of them looks like nose.
 Exactly.
 So, in this one, you --
 the part of the eye in the really pixeled image
 is going to be darker of the eye section because of --
 in most cases,
 data sets are also, like,
 made on the most general part of society.
 So, mostly, you have darker persons.
 So, pixels are going to be darker in that area.
 So, that is the eye part and the lower part below is white.
 And in this one, you are having the nose part
 and you are having the eyes.
 And that is how face detection filter works.
 I mean, you have seen -- yeah.
 Isn't it?
 This is the nose.
 Like, the white part is the nose.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's this part.
 It's also this example is really to make --
 to show you that you have vertical and horizontal filters.
 Most of these, you have seen them probably in cameras,
 your own phone, which does face detection.
 It actually is capable of detecting your faces.
 And if you are using even image filters,
 that is how they -- in an easy way,
 detect your face right now.
 They are using other algorithms,
 but this is an easy way to do this.
 And it is from 2001.
 So, before any of the social media existed,
 you have seen it in vertical and horizontal.
 And yes, we can also do it diagonal.
 So, this is how it would look.
 Which means, when you are moving your head,
 that is why the camera still detects you,
 even if you are not straightforward looking at the camera.
 And, yeah.
 This brings us to the last slide,
 which basically on Thursday you are going to learn image features.
 Any questions before --
 here is some crazy animation that Marc has put in?
 I know.
